# product-demo
This Is the Base Repository of our Product App. As a developer of this team, you should start here by getting an overview of the technologies we use/plan to use in the future. This guide should also explain our choices and point you to other repositories you might need next. Ready to start?

# Technology Stack Choice #

This is a short guide on the stack of technologies we use and why. This covers both front and back-end, and also any external APIs and/or enablers we might use. There's also mention to some key points we've considered to the future, when we'll be scaling up the app.

## Front-End ##

There's no secret here. HTML + CSS + JavaScript. No need for reinventing the wheel, some of the best developer minds out there already said this is the best stack for Front-End App Development. In the next topics, you can read more about frameworks/libraries we use on the Front and why.

### HTML ###

We just use plain HTML here, no libraries :books: needed. 

### CSS ###

Why writing 327 times in my stylesheet that my theme color is #4169E1? Why not just create a variable theme-color-blue: #4169E1 and use it everywhere? We should be focusing in accomplishing more by writing less!

The use of variables, nested rules and other advantages are the reasons why we're using preprocessors at our Product App.

There was some short discussion between using SCSS or SASS as preprocessor, but we ended up chosing SASS since the jump from SCSS to SASS isn't that big and SASS is more commonly used by the industry, which is a big advantage since it has a wider community (which means more support). 

If this is new to you, please check [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html) 

### JavaScript ###

We're using a quite famous javascript library called React. ...
